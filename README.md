#Instructions: #
##Step one: ##
Using JQuery, BootStrap, and Angular.js, take the JSON in [tutorials.json](/tutorials.json "tutorials.json") and create a create a list using all of the elements in the json file. In other words, it should show images (all the same size), the title of the tutorial, and clickable url (that opens in a new page/tab) in a well formed, pleasing layout. You should not just dump the text to the screen. Take pride in how this looks. The example should allow filtering, sorting, and look great! 

I removed the requirement to use routes at this point. I will show you how to do these in class.

##Step two:##
Create an HTML blog post that introduces angular and explains step one to someone who is new to Angular.js. Use text, use screencaptures, use code snips, use whatever you like, but this blog post should demonstrate angular and explain it well using your example. Step two should be hosted in gh-pages. You code for the example should be in a project in github. Post your link in blackboard to the blog post.

**NOTE: You should layout your page with css and bootstrap, and it should look good. You are completely free (in fact you are encouraged to use any template you choose to use to do this). I used bootstrap and jeykll (a flatfile blogging system for mine), but you can easily just use bootstrap.**
